Student Academic Performance Analysis

Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing the academic performance of students based on various factors using a dataset containing information about students' final scores over three years. The dataset includes attributes such as gender, school, location, family background, and daily/weekly alcohol consumption. The analysis aims to uncover relationships between these factors and students' performance, providing insights into how certain variables impact academic success.

Key Features:
Data Import & Preprocessing: The dataset is imported from a CSV file into RStudio using various preprocessing techniques to ensure data integrity and usability.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Activities such as data exploration, visualization, and cleaning are performed to understand the dataset better and identify any potential patterns.

Statistical Analyses: The project investigates specific questions, such as:
Which gender performs better academically?
How does school type influence student performance?
What is the impact of alcohol consumption on academic results?
How does being in a romantic relationship affect students' grades and absences?
Does the distance of a student's accommodation from school affect their academic performance?

Tools & Technologies:
R & RStudio: The primary programming language and IDE used for data analysis.
R Packages: Utilization of various packages, including tidyverse for data manipulation and visualization, and gridExtra for advanced plotting techniques.

Analyses Conducted:
Gender Performance Comparison: Analysis of average grades by gender.
School Performance: Evaluation of student performance across different schools.
Impact of Alcohol Consumption: Investigating how alcohol consumption affects final grades.
Romantic Relationships and Academic Performance: Analyzing the effects of romance on student grades and attendance.
Travel Time Influence: Assessing how travel time impacts academic success.

Results:
The findings from this analysis are communicated through visualizations, which include box plots and violin plots that illustrate the relationships between the variables effectively.

Project Structure: 

1. The script can be found by accessing "Dipta Protim Guha (TP063351) - PFDA source code.R" file

2. An in depth report of the project can found by accessing the "Dipta Protim Guha (TP063351) - PFDA documentation.pdf" file.

3. Although the provided dataset for the completion of the project was lost, it is similar to the Student Performance Dataset by UCI Machine Learning Repository (same column names). The script can be run by importing the dataset from "student" folder containing 2 CSV files.
